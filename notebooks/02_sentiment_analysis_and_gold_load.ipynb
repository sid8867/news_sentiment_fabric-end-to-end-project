Premadasa Stadium on Saturday, February 21. However, persistent rain forced the match to be abandoned without a result.Now, attention shifts to India''s opening Super 8 fixture against South Africa on Sunday, February 22, at Narendra Modi Stadium. With the previous game washed out, fans are naturally concerned about the weather conditions for this high-stakes encounter.IND vs SA Weather UpdateAccording to AccuWeather, there is no forecast of rain in Ahmedabad on India vs South Africa Super 8 match day. Clear skies are expected, and spectators should be able to enjoy a full, uninterrupted contest. The temperature during the evening is likely to hover around 27°C.That said, dew could play a big role in the second innings. In earlier matches at this venue during the tournament, dew has been noticeable under lights, potentially aiding teams batting second.
