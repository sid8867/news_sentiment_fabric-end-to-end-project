🏗️ Architecture Overview
This project follows a streamlined end‑to‑end Microsoft Fabric architecture designed for automated data ingestion, transformation, machine learning enrichment, and reporting. A daily 9 AM Fabric Pipeline triggers a Copy Data activity that calls an external REST API and loads the raw JSON response into the Lakehouse Bronze layer. A first notebook processes the JSON into a structured tabular format, applies incremental loading logic, and writes the cleaned data to the Silver layer. A second notebook performs ML‑based sentiment analysis, adds a sentiment score column, and stores the enriched output in the Gold layer.
Power BI connects directly to the Gold tables to deliver interactive analytics. A Data Activator rule monitors Power BI data conditions and triggers automated email alerts whenever specified thresholds are met—providing real‑time insights and notifications.
